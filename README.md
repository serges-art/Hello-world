# Hello-world
Introduction to JavaScript. I'm working on projects that will allow me to begin an exploration of JavaScript.
Hi, my name is Serge Sory. I'm excited about this new adventure into the world of coding. I'm a beginner at this point,
but look forward to learning this new stuff. The change I committed to this file is a little description of myself. Software
engineering has always been a passion of mine.
